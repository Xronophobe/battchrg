 This script provides information about your remaining battery capacity while 
 not consuming too much space. It has been designed for being included in your
 shell prompt on your *Apple OS X* system.
 The point is, using only one character for this purpose. So I ended up with
 this solution: the only number provided is going to be the number
 representing the tenths of the remaining battery capacity percentage. Its
 colors' purpose is to help you determine this percentage slightly more
 accurately as explained below:


###                                   LEGEND

| SYMBOL   |   MEANING |
|  ---: | ---Â | 
| CHARACTERS:          |
|        F  | Battery is fully charged, or above 95% |
|    0 - 9  | This number represent tenths of the remaining capacity (in %) |
|    green  | Remaining capacity ends in either 0, 9, 8 or 7 |
|   yellow  | Remaining capacity ends in either 6, 5 or 4 |
|      red  | Remaining capacity ends in either 3, 2, or 1 |
|        E  | Battery has dropped below 20%. Becomes black if remaining |
|             capacity percentage ends in 2, 1 or 0. Blinking at and below 10% |
|BACKGROUND: |
|     blue  | Battery is charging |
|    white  | Battery is discharging |
|      red  | Battery level dropped to or below 20%. Blinking at and below 10% |

 I hope you will find this tool useful. Comments, bugreports are welcome at
