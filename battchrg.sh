# This script provides information about your remaining battery capacity while 
# not consuming too much space. It has been designed for being included in your
# shell prompt.
# The point is, using only one character for this purpose. So I ended up with
# this solution: the only number provided is going to be the number
# representing the tenths of the remaining battery capacity percentage. Its
# colors' purpose is to help you determine this percentage slightly more
# accurately as explained below:
#
#                                   LEGEND
#  SYMBOL   |   MEANING
#  -------------------- 
#
#  CHARACTERS:
#        F  | Battery is fully charged, or above 95%
#    0 - 9  | This number represent tenths of the remaining capacity (in %)
#    green  | Remaining capacity ends in either 0, 9, 8 or 7
#   yellow  | Remaining capacity ends in either 6, 5 or 4
#      red  | Remaining capacity ends in either 3, 2, or 1
#        E  | Battery has dropped below 20%. Becomes black if remaining
#             capacity percentage ends in 2, 1 or 0. Blinking at and below 10%
#
# BACKGROUND:
#     blue  | Battery is charging
#    white  | Battery is discharging
#      red  | Battery level dropped to or below 20%. Blinking at and below 10%
#
# I hope you will find this tool useful. Comments, bugreports are welcome at
